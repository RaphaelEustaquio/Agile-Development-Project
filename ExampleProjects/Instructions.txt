For the python GUI:
 - make sure python is installed on your machine
 - run "pip install flask"
 - run "pip install flask_sqlalchemy"
 - run "pip install requests"
 - two terminals will be required to run the app/GUI
 - one terminal will have to run the app:
    - on one terminal, make sure you cd to AgileDevelopmentProject/ExampleProjects/GuiProject/store
    - run "python .\app.py"
    - If the modules are installed properly, it should tell you that the app is running on a specific http server (mine is "http://127.0.0.1:5000")
    - If you copy and paste the http into a browser, a web page with a list of products should show up, this will let you know that it is running properly
- the second terminal will open the GUI:
    - on this second terminal, make sure you cd to AgileDevelopmentProject/ExampleProjects/GuiProject/store/GUI
    - run "python .\storegui.py"
    - this will open up the GUI and you can play around with it inside

For the RemindlyApp node application:
- make sure you download node.js on your machine
    - you can do this by going into your browser, searching up "node.js download" and then follow the instructions to download node.js (similar to how python was installed onto our machines)
- run "npm install passport"
- run "npm install passport-local"
- run "npm install express-session"
- run "npm install express"
- run "npm install ejs" 
- run "npm install express-ejs-layouts"
- run "npm install nodemon"
- in a terminal, cd to AgileDevelopmentProject/ExampleProjects/RemindlyApp
    - run "npm start"
    - if everything is installed properly, you should see another http where the server is running (mine is "localhost:3001/reminders")
    - copy and paste the http into a browser and you should see a login screen
    - login username is : jimmy123@gmail.com
    - login password is : jimmy123!
    - you will now have access to the app's functionality
